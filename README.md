## Vulnerability Analysis of Hybrid Android Apps (Web Application)
### Overview
Hybrid Android apps contain functions implemented in Javascript, which makes it possible to 
benefit from traditional web-based techniques. 

While there are already quite few tools that can be used for detecting Javascript-related 
vulnerabilities in traditional web applications, there are no available techniques that can
 be used for detecting Javascript related vulnerabilities in hybrid Android apps. 

This project is expected to be a toolchain that 
* (1) extracts the Javascript code from Android apps
* (2) analyses the extracted code for identifying potential vulnerabilities.

### Requirements
This project is implemented using Node.JS application, with Express.JS as its main web framework.
At the moment, as this application has not been containerised using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), so it requires:
* NPM v6.4.1 
* Node v11.1.0
* ApkTool
* WebStorm / IntelliJ IDE

### Installation

First, install all dependencies using this command: `npm install` under `package-json` file's directory.
You may open WebStorm / IntelliJ `terminal` and type it in there as the directory has been directed to root.

Please install APKTool and register environment variable in your machine. [Installation](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/)
As this application is a toolchain, it requires APKTool as one of the tool to extract the uploaded APK into the back-end of the application.

To run the application, press `SHIFT+F10` (green-play button at top right) to run `BIN\WWWW` file. 
Once the application running, by default it will redirect screen to default browser and open `localhost:3000` page.
